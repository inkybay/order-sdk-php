# InkyBay Shopify Order SDK

The **InkyBay Shopify Order SDK** enables merchants to securely receive and store all custom order files generated by the InkyBay Product Personalizer app. This SDK is installed on your own server and automatically fetches design files, order data, and related assets once a customized order is placed in your Shopify store.

---

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the SDK, please ensure:
- PHP is installed and properly configured on your server
- Your server is publicly accessible via HTTPS

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Obtain API Credentials and Configure Hook URL

Navigate to:

**InkyBay Admin → Settings → Add-Ons → Order Batch Download & Exporter → Settings**

- Activate the API to generate your **Access Key** and **Secret Key**
- Configure the **Hook URL**, which is the endpoint on your server where InkyBay will send the `orderId` and `itemId` after order processing is completed

---

### 2. Configure the SDK

1. Open the `conf.php` file
2. Set your credentials:
   - Replace `__ACCESS_KEY__` with your Access Key
   - Replace `__SECRET_KEY__` with your Secret Key

---

### 3. Set the Order Item Hook URL

Upload the SDK to your server and copy the SDK URL.

Then update the hook URL in:

**InkyBay Admin → Settings → Add-Ons → Order Item Hook URL**

- If your server automatically routes to `index.php`, no additional configuration is required
- Otherwise, append `/item.php` to the hook URL, for example:

```
https://your-server-domain/sdk-folder/item.php
```

After updating the hook URL:
- Click the **Test Hook** button
- Verify that order data and files are successfully created inside the `orders` directory

---

### 4. Customizing Order Data Collection

You may extend or modify the SDK to collect additional order-related information.

Refer to the sample implementation:

- [`extract.php`](https://github.com/inkybay/order-sdk-php/blob/main/extract.php)

---

## Notes

- This SDK is intended **only for Shopify merchants** who have installed the InkyBay Product Personalizer app
- Ensure proper server security practices when handling order data
